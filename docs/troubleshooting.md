# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Import fails with an error message
- Check the error logs in **BuddyPress > Error Logs** for detailed information.
- Ensure that the file format is correct and that all required fields are mapped.

### Export is slow or times out
- Consider using WP CLI for large datasets, or adjust the batch size in the plugin settings.
